Reference repository: https://github.com/chrisirhc/precompiled-grpc-in-bazel-python

Target Audience:
* If you're curious what the Developer Tools and Developer Platform Engineering teams do.
* Wondering what working with Bazel on a monorepo is like when you need to customize some tooling.
* Goes into customizing some rules without much depth into the rules themselves. It's a bit of learn by practicing by example.

Expects:
* some understanding of what tools that apply actions on code
* you don't have to know what protobuf or grpc are, except that they are tools that generate code in multiple programming languages including Python.

## Quick bit on Protocol Buffers (protobuf) and gRPC
[Protocol buffers \(protobuf\)](https://protobuf.dev/) is a data serialization format like JSON. One uses protobuf by writing files with the .proto extension to describe the schema of the data they are serializing. Protobuf works across multiple programming languages including Python, Java, etc. It has a code generator (protoc) that generates language-specific code from .proto files so that applications or services can serialize and deserialize data in the specified schema. Read more about it [here](https://protobuf.dev/).
[gRPC](https://grpc.io) is a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) interface built on top of protobuf format. An over-simplistic analogy is to relate how [tRPC](https://trpc.io/docs/rpc)/REST is to JSON is similar to how gRPC is to protobuf.
## üé¨ Starting State 
### Python monorepo managed by Bazel (aka ‚Äúthe monorepo‚Äù)
A number of [Python](https://www.python.org) services and libraries are in a monorepo managed by [Bazel](https://bazel.build). Some of these services and libraries use protobuf, so the monorepo also contains .proto files. The Bazel setup uses [rules_proto](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_proto) and [rules_proto_grpc](https://rules-proto-grpc.com/) rules to execute the protoc tool along with a gRPC plugin to compile .proto files into Python protobuf and gRPC code for interacting with protobuf and gRPC endpoints.
### Users reported that building locally on Mac fails
Due to [a Mac build issue](https://github.com/uber/hermetic_cc_toolchain/issues/10#issuecomment-1653731027) on hermetic cc toolchain, compiling protoc on Mac fails. This breaks local development on Mac.
## üéØ Goal State
* Building on Mac should just work
* Even better, shouldn‚Äôt need to build protoc on Mac (or supported platform).

* Tried:
  * Looking for precompiled toolchains. Found https://github.com/aspect-build/toolchains_protoc .
  * However, since the repository makes use of gRPC, the gRPC plugin itself requires a C++ compilation, as per https://github.com/aspect-build/toolchains_protoc/issues/21#issuecomment-2455503596 . 

Steps:

1. Prepare the executable tool.
    * Tools have their arguments as an input API. As long as the input arguments are compatible, we can swap out the tool. I checked that grpcio-tools offers the protoc compatible tool, since it is actually protoc but with a built-in grpc plugin.
    1. Add grpcio-tools Python package from pip.
    2. Make sure we can run it from py_binary as a tool.
2. Replace the tool used for the grpc compilation.
    1. Copy in python_grpc_compile definition and get it to work locally.
    2. Point grpc_plugin into a built-in tool, to validate whether it's using the right compiled protoc executable.

Gotchas:
* Which version of proto compiler is this using? Find out by going to: https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.67.0/bazel/grpc_deps.bzl

Appendix:
* How did I set up the example repository?
    * Use bazel modules, current standard for adding different capabilities into a repo
    * Use the same example proto files from grpc/ and follow their layout.
        * Start from: https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/tree/master/examples/python/python_grpc_compile
        * Trace it to https://github.com/rules-proto-grpc/rules_proto_grpc/tree/master/modules
    * Change paths so that the examples work again.
    * Fix weird edge cases with importing newer version bazel deps.
